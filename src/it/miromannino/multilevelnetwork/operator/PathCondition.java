 * path that satisfy a path pattern (like the content).
 *
 * one can use this in this way:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * 	new PathCondition() {
 *		@literal@Override
 *		public ConditionResult predicate(Path p) {
 *			if (p.getSize() > 5) return ConditionResult.DefinitelyFalse;
 *			if (p.getSize() == 5) return ConditionResult.True;
 *			return ConditionResult.False;
 *		}
 *	}

 * </pre>
 *
 * that means we want a path with a length that is equal to 5. If we have a path with a length that is greater than
 * 5 we can return {@code DefinitelyFalse}, because extending the path we will have wrong paths.
